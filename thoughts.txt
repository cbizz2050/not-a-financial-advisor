should have way of inputting standard time interval i.e. ! minute time '1m' and having a way to interface with other api input for 1 minute interval.


thinking alpca is the move for data (intrday and histrocail)
-> can request histricla w/ different time frames 
-> should be able to easly scale to crypto from stocks here also.
-> may be easier to scale data gatherting for traing with different time frames a little easier

Thinking that the web socket may be a little less data intensive(<- somehting like that) (Doing the intrday reqest gets like the day vs just getting one minute)

 
look into library that can easily go through different means of measuring time.
-> something that can go from timestamp to datetime object to string data etc...


Kinda thinking we can merge intraday and historcial
